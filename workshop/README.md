cargo run --bin exercise1_model -- --model timm/convnext_base.fb_in1k all

# Use smaller model for faster processing
cargo run --bin exercise1_model -- --model timm/convnext_nano.d1h_in1k all
```

### Storage Backends

Test different storage configurations:

```bash
# Memory storage (fast, temporary)
cargo run --bin exercise4_storage -- --storage memory

# File storage (persistent, slower)
cargo run --bin exercise4_storage -- --storage file --file embeddings.json
```

### Custom Thresholds

```

## üìä Understanding the Results

### Model Performance

- **Embedding Quality**: Well-normalized embeddings with L2 norm ‚âà 1.0
- **Processing Speed**: ~50-200ms per image depending on model size
- **Memory Usage**: ~100MB for atto model, ~500MB for base model

### Similarity Metrics

- **Cosine Similarity**: Best for normalized embeddings (recommended)
- **Euclidean Distance**: Sensitive to magnitude differences
- **Dot Product**: Combines angle and magnitude information
- **Manhattan Distance**: More robust to outliers

### Threshold Guidelines

- **0.95+**: Very strict, minimal false positives
- **0.85-0.95**: Balanced for most applications
- **0.7-0.85**: Lenient, higher recall
- **<0.7**: Very permissive, may allow false positives

### Performance Expectations

| Operation | Memory Storage | File Storage |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Registration | ~1-5ms | ~5-50ms |
| Authentication | ~1-10ms | ~5-100ms |
| Search (1000 users) | ~5-20ms | ~50-200ms |

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Model Download Fails**:
- Check internet connectivity
- Verify disk space (models are 100-500MB)
- Try different model variants

**Out of Memory**:
- Use smaller batch sizes
- Switch to nano model variant
- Close other memory-intensive applications

**Slow Performance**:
- Enable release mode: `cargo run --release --bin exercise1_model`
- Use smaller models for development
- Consider batch processing for multiple operations

**File Permission Errors**:
- Check write permissions in the workshop directory
- Avoid spaces in file paths
- Use absolute paths when possible

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging:

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --bin exercise5_integration demo
```

### Performance Optimization

For production use:

```bash
# Release mode with optimizations
cargo run --release --bin exercise5_integration interactive

# Profile performance
cargo run --release --bin exercise1_model benchmark
```

## üìà Performance Tuning

### Model Selection

| Model | Size | Speed | Accuracy |
|-------|------|-------|----------|
| convnext_nano | ~50MB | Fast | Good |
| convnext_atto | ~100MB | Medium | Better |
| convnext_base | ~500MB | Slow | Best |

### Batch Size Optimization

- **Single images**: Use individual processing
- **2-8 images**: Optimal batch size for most hardware
- **16+ images**: May cause memory issues on limited hardware

### Storage Strategy

- **< 1,000 users**: In-memory storage acceptable
- **1,000-10,000 users**: File storage with caching
- **10,000+ users**: Consider vector database (Qdrant, Pinecone)
