# Exercise 06: Complete Face Authentication System

This is the final exercise where you'll build a complete face authentication system by applying everything you've learned in exercises 1-5. The application contains **TODO markers** that correspond to the concepts and implementations you should have mastered in the previous exercises.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By completing this exercise, you will:
- **Integrate** all components from exercises 1-5 into a working application
- **Apply** image processing, embeddings, similarity computation, and storage concepts
- **Build** a production-ready face authentication system
- **Understand** how all the pieces fit together in a real application

## üìö Prerequisites

Before starting this exercise, you should have completed:

1. **Exercise 01** - Image Processing & ImageNet Normalization
2. **Exercise 02** - ConvNeXt Model & Embedding Generation  
3. **Exercise 03** - Cosine Similarity & Face Comparison
4. **Exercise 04** - Local File Storage for Embeddings
5. **Exercise 05** - Vector Retrieval & Similarity Search

## üîß What You'll Implement

This application contains **TODO sections** that map directly to your previous learning:

### TODOs from Exercise 01 (Image Processing)
- Image preprocessing and normalization functions
- Converting images to model-ready tensors

### TODOs from Exercise 02 (Embeddings)

- Cosine similarity calculation between embeddings
- L2 normalization for embedding comparison

### TODOs from Exercise 04 (Storage)
- Local file storage implementation
- Embedding persistence and retrieval

### TODOs from Exercise 05 (Retrieval)

## üöß Current Implementation Status

**Note**: This exercise currently contains a **working implementation** that serves as a reference. The code includes:

- ‚úÖ **Complete camera integration** with live video streaming
- ‚úÖ **Full registration and login workflows**

2. **Practice Mode**: Create your own TODO version by commenting out implementations
3. **Extension Mode**: Add new features like multiple face storage per user, confidence thresholds, or improved UI

The fully functional code demonstrates how exercises 1-5 combine into a production-ready system.

## üöÄ Application Features

Once completed, your system will provide:

- **User Authentication**: Compare captured faces with stored embeddings
- **Configurable**: Easy configuration via YAML file

## üîç Finding and Completing TODOs

### Step 1: Locate TODO Markers
Search for `TODO` comments throughout the codebase. These mark the exact locations where you need to apply your knowledge from exercises 1-5:

```bash
# Find all TODOs in the project
grep -r "TODO" src/
```

### Step 2: Map TODOs to Exercises
Each TODO will reference which exercise concept it relates to:
- `TODO: Exercise 01` - Image processing functions
- `TODO: Exercise 02` - Model and embedding functions  
- `TODO: Exercise 03` - Similarity computation functions
- `TODO: Exercise 04` - Storage implementation functions
- `TODO: Exercise 05` - Retrieval and search functions

### Step 3: Implement Solutions
Use your implementations from the previous exercises to fill in the TODO sections. The exact function signatures and requirements will be provided in the TODO comments.

### Step 4: Test Your Implementation
After completing each TODO section, test the functionality:

```bash
# Test individual components
cargo test

# Run the full application
cargo run
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

## Prerequisites

### Camera Server Setup

Before running the face authentication system, you need to start the camera server:

1. **Navigate to camera server directory**:
   ```bash
   cd ../camera_server
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Start the camera server**:
   ```bash
   python camera_stream_api.py
   ```

4. **Verify camera stream**: Open http://localhost:8000/video_feed in your browser

### System Requirements
- **Camera**: Webcam or external camera connected to your system
- **Python 3.7+**: For the camera server
- **Rust 1.70+**: For the main application

## Configuration

The system uses `config.yaml` for configuration:

### Storage Configuration

```yaml
storage:
  type: "local_file"
  local_file:
    path: "embeddings.json"
```

## Usage

### Running the Application

```bash
cargo run
```

### Commands

- `register` - Register a new user by capturing face embeddings
- `login` - Authenticate an existing user  
- `quit` or `exit` - Exit the application

**Note**: Commands are entered without the `/` prefix (e.g., type `register`, not `/register`)

### Registration Process

1. Run the `register` command
2. Enter a user name
3. Look at the camera while the system captures multiple face samples
4. The system will store embeddings in your configured storage

### Authentication Process

1. Run the `login` command
2. Enter your registered user name
3. Look at the camera for authentication
4. The system will compare your face with stored embeddings

## Storage

The system uses local file storage to store face embeddings in JSON format. This provides:

- **Simplicity**: No external dependencies required
- **Reliability**: Works offline and is easy to backup
- **Transparency**: Human-readable JSON format for debugging

## Configuration Options

### Stream Configuration

```yaml
stream:
  url: "http://localhost:8000/video_feed"  # Video stream URL
  num_images: 5                           # Number of samples to capture
  interval_millis: 10                     # Interval between samples
  chunk_size: 8192                        # Network chunk size
```

### Model Configuration

```yaml
model:
  name: "timm/convnext_atto.d2_in1k"     # Model name
  embedding_size: 768                     # Embedding vector size
```
