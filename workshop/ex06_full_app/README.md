# Exercise 06: Complete Face Authentication System

This is the final exercise where you'll build a complete face authentication system by applying everything you've learned in exercises 1-5. The application contains **TODO markers** that correspond to the concepts and implementations you should have mastered in the previous exercises.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By completing this exercise, you will:
- **Integrate** all components from exercises 1-5 into a working application
- **Apply** image processing, embeddings, similarity computation, and storage concepts
- **Build** a production-ready face authentication system
- **Understand** how all the pieces fit together in a real application

## üìö Prerequisites

Before starting this exercise, you should have completed:

1. **Exercise 01** - Image Processing & ImageNet Normalization
2. **Exercise 02** - ConvNeXt Model & Embedding Generation  
3. **Exercise 03** - Cosine Similarity & Face Comparison
4. **Exercise 04** - Local File Storage for Embeddings
5. **Exercise 05** - Vector Retrieval & Similarity Search

## üîß What You'll Implement

This application contains **TODO sections** that map directly to your previous learning:

### TODOs from Exercise 01 (Image Processing)
- Image preprocessing and normalization functions
- Converting images to model-ready tensors

### TODOs from Exercise 02 (Embeddings) 
- Model loading and initialization
- Face embedding computation from images

### TODOs from Exercise 03 (Similarity)
- Cosine similarity calculation between embeddings
- L2 normalization for embedding comparison

### TODOs from Exercise 04 (Storage)
- Local file storage implementation
- Embedding persistence and retrieval

### TODOs from Exercise 05 (Retrieval)
- Similarity search across stored embeddings
- Top-k retrieval for face matching

## üöÄ Application Features

Once completed, your system will provide:

- **Face Embedding Generation**: Uses ConvNeXt model to generate high-quality face embeddings
- **Local File Storage**: Stores embeddings in JSON format for simplicity
- **Real-time Face Registration**: Capture and store face embeddings from video stream
- **User Authentication**: Compare captured faces with stored embeddings
- **Configurable**: Easy configuration via YAML file

## üîç Finding and Completing TODOs

### Step 1: Locate TODO Markers
Search for `TODO` comments throughout the codebase. These mark the exact locations where you need to apply your knowledge from exercises 1-5:

```bash
# Find all TODOs in the project
grep -r "TODO" src/
```

### Step 2: Map TODOs to Exercises
Each TODO will reference which exercise concept it relates to:
- `TODO: Exercise 01` - Image processing functions
- `TODO: Exercise 02` - Model and embedding functions  
- `TODO: Exercise 03` - Similarity computation functions
- `TODO: Exercise 04` - Storage implementation functions
- `TODO: Exercise 05` - Retrieval and search functions

### Step 3: Implement Solutions
Use your implementations from the previous exercises to fill in the TODO sections. The exact function signatures and requirements will be provided in the TODO comments.

### Step 4: Test Your Implementation
After completing each TODO section, test the functionality:

```bash
# Test individual components
cargo test

# Run the full application
cargo run
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

## Configuration

The system uses `config.yaml` for configuration:

### Storage Configuration

```yaml
storage:
  type: "local_file"
  local_file:
    path: "embeddings.json"
```

## Usage

### Running the Application

```bash
cargo run
```

### Commands

- `register` - Register a new user by capturing face embeddings
- `login` - Authenticate an existing user
- `quit` or `exit` - Exit the application

### Registration Process

1. Run the `register` command
2. Enter a user name
3. Look at the camera while the system captures multiple face samples
4. The system will store embeddings in your configured storage

### Authentication Process

1. Run the `login` command
2. Enter your registered user name
3. Look at the camera for authentication
4. The system will compare your face with stored embeddings

## Storage

The system uses local file storage to store face embeddings in JSON format. This provides:

- **Simplicity**: No external dependencies required
- **Reliability**: Works offline and is easy to backup
- **Transparency**: Human-readable JSON format for debugging

## Configuration Options

### Stream Configuration

```yaml
stream:
  url: "http://localhost:8000/video_feed"  # Video stream URL
  num_images: 5                           # Number of samples to capture
  interval_millis: 10                     # Interval between samples
  chunk_size: 8192                        # Network chunk size
```

### Model Configuration

```yaml
model:
  name: "timm/convnext_atto.d2_in1k"     # Model name
  embedding_size: 768                     # Embedding vector size
```
